## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Critical Sections:
1. **Frontend Script Enqueue Configuration** - Must be implemented correctly or nothing works
2. **Security Notes** - Must follow all security guidelines
3. **Singleton Pattern** - Don't create multiple instances
4. **AJAX Endpoints** - Must match nonce verification

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
1. ❌ Enqueueing JavaScript without jQuery dependency
2. ❌ Localizing script before enqueuing
3. ❌ Using `new` with singleton class
4. ❌ Wrong nonce action name
5. ❌ Loading scripts for non-logged-in users
6. ❌ Skipping file existence checks
7. ❌ Not handling upload errors

### Best Practices:
1. ✅ Always check file existence before enqueue
2. ✅ Use singleton pattern consistently
3. ✅ Verify nonces on all AJAX requests
4. ✅ Sanitize all user inputs
5. ✅ Log errors in debug mode
6. ✅ Test across different browsers
7. ✅ Keep documentation updated
